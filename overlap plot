## Question 3 - part2
### Devise and calculate a metric for the degree of overlap between their ranges, explaining how you calculated it.

```{r, warning=FALSE}
#Creating SpatialPoints for lion coordinates
lion_sp <- SpatialPoints(coords = lion.coords[, c("lon", "lat")])

#Creating SpatialPoints for zebra coordinates
zebra_sp <- SpatialPoints(coords = zebra.coords[, c("lon", "lat")])

#Finding the intersection of the two SpatialPoints objects
intersect_sp <- gIntersection(lion_sp, zebra_sp)

#Calculating the percentage overlap between the lion and zebra ranges
lion_range_area <- gArea(gConvexHull(lion_sp))

zebra_range_area <- gArea(gConvexHull(zebra_sp))
overlap_area <- gArea(gConvexHull(intersect_sp))
overlap_pct <- overlap_area / (lion_range_area + zebra_range_area - overlap_area) * 100

#Display result
overlap_pct
```
